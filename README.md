# Python-Necessary-Knowladge

This repository contains some materials those imporved my Python skills a lot. 

### Data Manipulation in python 
Jupyter Notebook file showing detailed data manipulation skills and tips by two packages: Pandas and Numpy. 
These two packages are so popular and useful that every Python learner and user should be famalier with. 
This file has bacome a handbook for me when I deal with manipulation problems and need to clarify some syntax. 

### Missing Value with Pandas
Dealing with missing values is a crucial step in data preprocessing. Missing data may have great influence on the quality of data itself and the correspoding performance of modeling and predictions, etc. 
This file shows how to deal with missing values with Pandas specifically. 

### Python Visualization 
Data visualization is a necessary skill for any business analyst and data analyst, even data scientist and data engineer. Even there are many visualization tools those are pretty esay to use and provide great performance, I would say Python visualization is still useful to learn. It makes the Python file more complete, and users can try matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc. with different objectives. 

### Time Series / NLP Topic Modeling / Gradient Boosting / PyTorch linear regression
These files contains information in several specific topics and fields of data. This part is about to be added in the future.
